      <p>
        Thank you for using YT Remote. This privacy policy outlines how we
        handle data within our Chrome extension.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Use</h2>
      <p>
        YT Remote does not collect any data externally. All data used by the
        extension remains within the extension environment on your local device.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>User Settings</strong>: Any preferences or settings are stored
          locally within the extension to improve your experience and
          personalize playback controls.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Google Account Information (Optional)</strong>: With your
          permission, the extension may use your Google user ID and email to
          enable future personalization features within YT Remote. This
          information is used solely within the extension and is not collected
          or transmitted externally.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
      <p>
        YT Remote requires certain permissions to provide its core
        functionality:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Storage</strong>: Used only to save your preferences locally
          on your device.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Identity and Identity.Email</strong>: Used within the
          extension to retrieve your Google user ID and email address. These
          permissions are strictly for optional, in-app features and are not
          shared outside the extension.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Access to YouTube</strong>: The extension operates only on
          YouTube (<code>https://www.youtube.com/*</code>) to control video
          playback.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        Your information is stored locally on your device and is never
        collected, transmitted, or stored on external servers. YT Remote does
        not access or use third-party services for data processing or storage.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        YT Remote does not integrate with any third-party services that access
        or process your information. All data handling is within the extension
        itself.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy periodically. If there are significant
        changes, we will update the policy within the extension. We recommend
        reviewing this policy from time to time.
      </p>
