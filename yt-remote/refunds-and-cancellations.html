      <h1>Refunds & Cancellations</h1>
      <p class="date">Last updated: 10th November 2024</p>

      <p>
        Thank you for supporting YT Remote. This policy outlines the terms for
        refunds and cancellations for the one-time purchase of the YT Remote
        extension.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Refund Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        Refunds are provided under specific circumstances, as outlined below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical Issues:</strong> If the extension fails to function
          as intended due to a technical issue that cannot be resolved after
          troubleshooting, you may request a refund within 14 days of purchase.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accidental Purchase:</strong> If you made the purchase
          accidentally, you may request a refund within 7 days of the
          transaction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Duplicate Purchases:</strong> Refunds will be issued for
          duplicate payments for the same extension license.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Non-Refundable Situations</h2>
      <p>The following situations are not eligible for refunds:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Change of mind after purchase.</li>
        <li>
          Incompatibility with your device or browser, if not listed in our
          compatibility requirements.
        </li>
        <li>Failure to use the extension after purchase.</li>
        <li>
          Purchases made through unauthorized third-party platforms or
          resellers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Cancellation Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Since YT Remote operates on a one-time payment model, there is no
        recurring subscription or automatic billing. Cancellations are not
        applicable after purchase, as the product is provided immediately upon
        payment.
      </p>

      <h2>4. How to Request a Refund</h2>
      <p>
        To request a refund, contact us at <strong>shraey2020@gmail.com</strong>
        with the following information:
      </p>
      <ul>

        <li>
          A detailed explanation of the issue or reason for requesting the
          refund.
        </li>
        <li>Any supporting documentation or screenshots, if applicable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Refund requests will be reviewed and processed within 7 business days.
        Approved refunds will be credited back to the original payment method.
      </p>

        We may update this refunds and cancellations policy from time to time.

        official channels. Please review this page periodically for updates.
